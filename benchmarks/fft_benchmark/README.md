Provided by David Bowler to test performance of FFTs

Iâ€™m not sure how much time it spends specifically in FFTs but there should be some noticeable time.  You could try increasing the Grid.GridCutoff parameter to 400 if you want to make it harder.  I can also increase the cell size which should push the total time spent in FFTs up.
