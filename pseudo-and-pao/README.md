This directory contains sample pseudopotentials and pseudo-atomic
orbital (PAO) basis sets for elements in the [PseudoDojo
database](http://www.pseudo-dojo.org) (roughly speaking up to 86Rn)
in the directories LDA, PBE and PBEsol.  It also contains GTH/HGH
pseudopotentials from the CP2K project in the directories GTH_LDA
and GTH_PBE.

It also includes the input files you will need for generating basis
sets of your own using the CONQUEST basis generation code.  More
details are found in the documentation directory.

The potentials are available for LDA, PBE and PBEsol
exchange-correlation functionals.
