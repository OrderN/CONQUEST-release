This directory contains GTH/HGH pseudopotentials for the PBE XC functional 
with partial core corrections (also known as non-linear core corrections)
based on the data distributed with CP2K (which in turn tabulates the results 
in Phys. Rev. B 54, 1703 (1996), Phys. Rev. B 58, 3641 (1998), Theor. Chem. 
Acc. 114, 145 (2005) and J. Chem. Phys. 138, 104109 (2013)).

Note that these are not tested by the CONQUEST developers, and should be treated
with care.  In particular, PAO generation is at present in beta phase.
